Loonshots -- neglected, widely dismissed projects that are so innovative that they were able to win wars, cure diseases and transform industries.

Phase transitions

One of the most interesting observations:

>>> When people organize into a team, a company, or any kind of group with a mission they also create two competing forces -- for forms of incentives. We can think of the two competing incentives, loosely, as _stake_ and _rank_.

>>> When groups are small [...] everyone's _stake_ in the outcome of the goup project is high. At a small biotech, if the drug works, everyone will be a hero and a millionaire. If it fails, everyone will be looking for a job. The perks of _rand_ -- job titles or the increase in salary from being promoted -- are small compared to those high stakes.

>>> As teams and companies grow larger, the stakes in outcome decrease while the perks of rank increase. When the two cross, the system snaps. Incentives begin encouraging behavior no one wants. Those same groups -- with the same people -- begin rejecting loonshots.

# Bush-Vail Rules
Both Bush and Vail recognized that the big ideas -- the breakthroughs that change the course of science, business and history -- fail many times before they succeed.

>>> The breakthroughs that change the world are born from the marriage of genius and serendipity

>>> Luck is the residue of design

>>> The ones who truly succeed -- the engineers of serendipity -- play a more humble role. Rather than champion any individual loonshot, they create an outstanding _structure_ for nurturing many loonshots. Rather than visionary innovators, they are careful gardeners. They ensure that both loonshots and franchises are tended well, that neither side dominates the other, and that each side nurtures and supports the other.

>>> Separate your artists and soldiers.

>>> The goal of the separation is to create a _loonshot nursery_. The nursery protects those embryonic projects. It allows caregivers to design a sheltered environment where those projects can grow, flourish, and shed their warts.

>> Love your artists and soldiers equally.

# Hindsight?
The question is of course if you can only spot loonshots in hindsight?

# Why Do We Need a Loonshot Nursery for Information Security?
In modern industries, information security is usually attributed to a set of topics referred to as _non-functional requirements_. These are the opposite of so-called functional requirements like product's performance, design, or user experience.

If not nurtured, infosec is mostly overlooked.

Is it true that we will "loose the war" if we neglect and abandon non-functional requirements like information security? In other words, would it be legitimate to say that without security, you might win this or that battle -- in the sense of slightly increasing the revenue of one or two products -- but you would loose a war in the sense of jeopardizing your entire business? Or, maybe, the question to ask would be: why would this be the case?

There are several answers I'd like to offer:
1. Many topics that were very prominent in the past have become or are in the process of becoming a commodity. Can we give at least an "anecdotical evidence" for this? Think of operating systems (see Linux and its derivates), think about programming languages, development tools, design tools, connectivity, transmitter chips, manufacturing processes, libraries e.g., for numerical methods, machine learning, etc., frameworks for building applications (that look awesome), software development methodologies, communication standards. Safety, Security, and Privacy are among the very few areas where it is still possible to differentiate itself from the competitors. If numerous manufacturers are able to offer products that have good performance, look good and offer a good user experience, I will go for the one that fulfills most of the NFRs. If you look at Apple, they seem to have understood this. In any case, you will be **one out of many** (part of the reason is that information technology as a discipline has become mature over the last 4-5 decades. We learned how to build large, complex, interconnected, distrubuted systems. In addition -- in contrast to other disciplines like art or literature -- information technology is actually rather easy to teach. Once the experience of a few decades of software development and managing software projects has been distilled in a number of books, articles, blogs, etc., it became pretty easy to grasp for newcomers. IT can be learned rather easy -- in the sense that if you give someone 30-40 good books on IT, she/he will be able to learn what is needed to start, i.e., very solid fundamentals. Whether you like it or not, information technology (IT) is not some kind of a black art that only a few chosen ones are able to master; Rather, it is a field that has a very systematic body of knowledge that was captured in numerous books, articles, and open source software products/projects. Anyone with enough willingness and curiosity is able to leverage this systematic body of knowledge to become an IT expert. The other part of the reason is that we as an industry were able to actually codify our distilled knowledge -- nowadays, you can find hundreds of excellent libraries and software frameworks that already include the distilled software engineering and IT knowledge of the decades. And the free software movement is a major part of this.)
2. will there be some kind of a tipping event? I mean, if we continue to put information technology at the same rate into new products and services that we have used throughout the last 1 or 2 decades, it is actually very clear that soon - in 3 to 5 years - it will be easier to harm someone by hacking him than by beating him up. And that does not only apply to individuals, it also applies to societies. So information security, privacy and safety will become crucial also from the purely economic point of view. That is, the customers will demand these "features".
3. Finally, infosec and privacy will become crucial for our civil rights.
