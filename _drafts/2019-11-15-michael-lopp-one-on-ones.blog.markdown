# How this Post Came About
Recently, I started reading a book by Michael Lopp called ["Managing Humans"](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/managing-humans-third-edition/) (3rd edition). I bought the book quite a while ago after flipping through some management books on Amazon. When the book came in the mail, I actually tucked it away into some bookshelve and forgot about it. Several weeks ago - by pure coincidence - I re-discovered the book and began to read. What I was reading turned out to be extremely vivid and refreshing descriptions of various business situations one encounters when dealing with humans. The text reminded me so much of my own experiences that it immediately started to resonate with me.

One of the things Michael -- or Rands, as he'd like to be called -- talks about in his book are one-on-ones. Rand's treatement of this topics is very crisp, straight forward, and funny to read. I won't reproduce what Michael wrote (also because I don't want to spoiler this). Instead, I would like to refer to some of Michael's thoughts on one-on-ones and share my personal experience and some of my own musings.

# Setting the Stage
Michael starts of with the observation that business is noisy -- people worry loudly about projects, processes, and other people and have opinions that they share all over the place, all the time. The problem is: This collective chatter, as Michael calls it, will bury the individual voice if no one pays attention. So according to Michael, the manager's job in a one-on-one is to pay attention (because it's best done in this setting) and to give the smallest voice a chance to be heard.



Your job in a one-on-one is to give the smallest voice a chance to be heard, and I start with a question: "How are you?"

It was funny to read that Lopp opens his 1 on 1s with the above question. Sure, it is vague enough so that the recipient can't help but put part of themselves into the answer. But the main reason I usually start the conversion with that question is because I genuinely care about the people I manage. 

# The Basics of One-on-Ones
Michael Lopp postulates three basic rules he follows regarding one-on-ones:

* Holding a one-one-one at the same time each week. Constantly holding your one-on-ones at the scheduled time is a strong signal and a reminder for the folks that you are here for them, no matter how busy you are.
* Always do it. It's easy to deprioritize a one-on-one because, unlike the usual super-urgent things, a one-on-one doesn't represent an urgent problem that needs solving. However, you have to understand that each time you bail on a one-on-one, the person you're managing hears: "You don't matter".
* Give it 30 minutes, at least. I really like the quote from here: "It's the best I can do, I've got 15 people working for me. -- First, those 15 people don't work for you; you work for them. If those 15 people left, how much work would actually get done?"

# How Are You?
What's the first thing they say? Do they reflect with humor? Is it the standard off-the-cuff answer? Or is it different? How is it different? What words do they choose and how quickly are they saying them? According to Lopp, based on the answer, you're about to have:

* the update (all clear!)
* the vent (something's up ...)
* the disaster (oh dear ...)

While the majority of one-on-ones falls into the first bucket, when it comes down to the other two buckets, the answer to the question "How are you?" is ... off.  People either state this up front with the alarming "We need to talk" proclamation -- which immediately throws you into the Vent bucket -- or their answer is the quiet one, the answer that contains something really troublesome.

# The Update
You get exactly what you expect from an update -- it's status: these are my projects, these are my tasks, and this is how it's going. Most people consider this type of one-on-one to be a success. But they're wrong. A one-on-one is not a project meeting, it's not a status report. If you think of a one-on-one where you discuss data you could find in a status report as a success, you're missing the point. A one-on-one is an opportunity to learn something new amidst the grind of daily business.

When a one-on-one starts and is clearly an update, I start listening twice as hard for a nugget of something that we can discuss, investigate, and explore. It's not that I don't care about status, but if we fill the one-on-one time with data I can find scrubbing the bug database or the wiki, we're both wasting our time.

If I don't find a meaty conversation within the first 15 minutes, I've got three moves:

* _Three prepared points_: I usually have three talking points that have shown up and I'll start with one of these points and see where that takes us.
* _The mini performance review_: It's not an actual performance review, but rather one aspect of the review that somehow strikes me as more appropriate conversation than an update on your bug counts. (I don't do this, though)
* _My current disaster_: Chances are, something is currently of rails. The point is not to solve my disaster; the point is that we're going to have a conversation where one of us is going to learn something more than just project status.

All in all, business is noisy because there is always something to do, and the process of doing stuff is called _tactics_. It's tactical work, and while tactics are progress, the real progress is made when we get strategic. A productive one-on-one is one where we talk strategically about how we do stuff, but more importantly, how we might do this stuff better.

# The Vent
A really good vent starts with a disarmingly long period of silence. I've just asked my soft opener and you're quiet. I can see you mentally gathering steam. I take this time to ground myself, because I know a vent is coming. 

When the vent begins, you might confuse this for a conversation. It's not. It's a mental release valve, and your job is to listen for as long as it takes. Don't problem solve. Don't redirect. Don't comfort. Yet. Your employee is doing mental house cleaning, and interrupting this cleaning is missing the point. They don't want a solution; they want to be heard. 

A vent does have a conclusion. There is a point where you need to jump in, but these conclusions and your actions vary:

* _It's done_: The vent starts to lose steam and the venter finds themselves panting and staring at you with nothing to say because they've said it all. It's the moment you begin to triage. _Great, now we start talking_ ...
* _It's a rant_: A vent can repeat itself. At some point, the vent becomes a rant. After a couple of repetitions, you might try grabbing hold of the conversation and starting with triage, but beware - the venter might not be done. So in doubt, let them ho another round. Whatever the backstory, ranters have no interest in solving the actual problem at this point. When you have a confirmed rant on your hands, it's OK to jump into the middle of the vent -- you're saving everyone a pile of time, and you're teaching the ranter that the incessant restatement of the rant is not progress.
* _It's a disaster_: The vent is moving forward and it's not repeating itself, it feels like an attack. What started out as an emotional conversation has transformed into a war, and you're suddenly and unexpectedly on the battlefield. If you see a disaster coming, try to tuck all your emotions in a box, lock that box, and prepare for a fight. Because at this point, the venter wants to fight.

# The Disaster
When facing a disaster, remember a few things:

* The person you're taking to isn't him- or herself. Your experiencing an anomaly -- a bizzare emotional version of the person that only shows up when they're on the edge. The person you're familiar with will eventually show up.
* Shut up. Really. Your primary job during the disaster is to defuse, and you defuse by contributing absolutely nothing. You'll be tempted to ask clarifying questions, try to shape the problem. Don't. Be quiet. Let the emotion pass.
* It's not about the issue anymore. You're no longer experiencing the problem. You're experiencing the employee's emotional baggage. Sure, there's the core issue, but that's not what you're currently observing -- you're observing an extremely negative reaction.

# Assume They Have Something to Teach You
The cliche is, "People are your most valuable resource". I would argue that they are your only resource. Computers, desks, buildings, data centers, etc. only support your one and only resource: your people. A one-on-one offers a regular opportunity for you to see where dissatisfaction might quietly appear. A one-on-one is your chance to perform preventive maintenance while also understanding the health of your team. It's an opportunity to listen for what your employee isn't saying.
