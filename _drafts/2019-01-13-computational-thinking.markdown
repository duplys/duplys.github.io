# Compulogy
The term obviously has something to do with computation, and -- broadly speaking -- mathematics. But also with computers in general and everthing that is related to computers and computation.

# What's Compulogy, Anyway?
In his wonderful book "Coding the Matrix", Philip N. Klein writes: "[...] a linear-algebra instructor whose pupils are students of computer science has a special advantage: her students are computationally sophisticated. They have a learning modality that most students don't---they can learn through reading, writing, debugging, and using computer programs. [...] _Computational thinking_ is the term suggested by Jeannette Wing, former head of the National Science Foundation's directorate on Computer and Information Science and Engineering, to refer to the skills and concepts that a student of computer science can bring to bear. For this book, computational thinking is the road to mastering elementary linear algebra."

Likewise, I would like this blog to be a computational thinking-driven way to understand phenomena in mathematics, physics, economics, politics, business, social sciences, biology, ...
