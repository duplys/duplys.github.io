In [Griffor et al][griffor], I stumbled upon the idea set forth by Tunc, Hariri, and Battou that diversity should be used to avoid the _software monoculture problem_ where one attack vector can successfully attack many instances of the same software module.

While this seems to be a reasonable proposition at first, I think the authors underestimate the effort needed to maintain the software. As an example, if I have 3 implementations of the same functionality in 3 different programming languages, my maintenance effort needs to be 3 times as high.

Without having more people to maintain the software, I will end up having much less time to review and test the code of each of the 3 code bases. As a result, while the 3 implementations will not have many identical bugs, the likelihood of bugs in each individual code base will be higher.

As a consequence, instead of having to maintain more code, it is very reasonable to have just one code base and verify this code base with the ultimate goal to remove all bugs.
