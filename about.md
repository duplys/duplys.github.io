I'm a security researcher working at Robert Bosch GmbH, a Tier-1 automotive supplier and manufacturer of industrial and consumer goods. Since 2007, I'm doing applied research in the area of side channel attacks (SCA), countermeasures and evaluation methodologies. In 2014, I got my PhD from the University of Tuebingen on side channel evaluation method tailored for the automotive domain.

From 2012 to 2014, I was involved in the research on physical-layer security (PHYSEC), in particular authenticated key agreement from channel measurements in wireless communications protocols like WiFi.

Currently, I'm supervising a PhD thesis on physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Among other things, PUFs enable highly secure storage of cryptographic keys on embedded platforms, in particular in the Internet of Things.

In addition to SCA and PUFs, I study methods & tools that help to spot and eliminate vulnerabilities in (low-level) software. Being a computer scientist by education, I'm deeply concerned with the ramifications of insecure software systems.

I'm a huge fan of *nix, especially Debian/Ubuntu GNU/Linux, as well as Emacs and LaTeX (thanks Donald!). I used to code quite a lot in Ruby, and still think it's the best language in terms of its combination of code elegance and language features. However, due to many excellent libraries like numpy, scipy, scikit.learn, etc., I started using Python couple of years ago. Lately, I'm interested in functional programming languages like Lisp, Scheme, Elixir, and Haskell.

I love books, in particular non-fiction, scientific writing. Usually, I'm buying more books than I manage to read (in my spare time). My all-time favorite fiction writers include -- but are not limited to -- Paul Auster, Isaac Asimov, and Douglas Adams.

I'm also passionate about mathematics, although I don't have a university-level formal education in this subject (other than couple of introductory classes taken during my computer science studies). I'm primarily interested in number theory, and topics like finite fields and elliptic curves. This is partly related to my job; the other part of me is simply fascinated by the beauty of mathematics.
